# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points. 
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```
import math
x1 = 10
y1 = 6
x2 = 4
y2 = 2

distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
